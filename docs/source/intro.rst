The package in `kgcnn <https://github.com/aimat-lab/gcnn_keras/tree/master/kgcnn>`_ contains several layer classes to build up graph convolution models.
Some models are given as an example.
A documentation is generated in `docs <https://github.com/aimat-lab/gcnn_keras/tree/master/docs>`_.
Any comments, suggestions or help are very welcome!
