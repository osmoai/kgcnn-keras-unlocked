# Test Assets

External files required for test cases can be placed here. Also artifacts generated by certain test cases 
can be placed into this folder.

The path to this folder is available from within a unittest via:

```python
import os
from .utils import ASSETS_PATH
file_path = os.path.join(ASSETS_PATH, 'README.md')
```
